## About Me

### I am from **Brazil** 🇧🇷 but moved to **Toronto** 🇨🇦 when I was 10! 

### 🧠 I’m currently in my fourth year of *Neuroscience* at dal 🐯

I chose *Neuroscience* as my major because the brain 🧠 fascinates me! 

I have been involed in 🔎 healthcare research 👩‍🔬 since **highschool** and am very excited to pursue that in the *future*. This course 💻 will give me plenty of skills for my *future career* and will help me gain helpful knowledge for the coding portion of my Honours Project that I am completing in the Crowder Lab 🐭 !
